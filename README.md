ofxCX
=====================================

Introduction
------------
ofxCX (hereafter referred to as CX) is a "total conversion mod" for openFrameworks that is used for creating psychology experiments.

Licence
-------
State which licence you offer your addon under. openFrameworks is distributed under the [MIT License](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License), and you might consider using this for your repository. By default, `license.md` contains a copy of the MIT license to which you can add your name and the year.

Installation
------------
Drop the CX directory into openFrameworks/addons.

Dependencies
------------
None

Compatibility
------------
This only works with oF version 0.8.0. It has only been tested on Windows, but may work completely on OSx. It should not work completely on Linux, although quite a bit of the functionality should.

Known issues
------------
This is pre-alpha software, don't expect it to be bug-free.

Version history
------------
It make sense to include a version history here (newest releases first), describing new features and changes to the addon. Use [git tags](http://learn.github.com/p/tagging.html) to mark release points in your repo, too!
