ofxCX (aka the C++ Experiment Development Library; hereafter referred to as CX) is a "total conversion mod" for openFrameworks (often abbreviated oF) that is designed to be used used for creating psychology experiments. OpenFrameworks and CX are based on C++, which is a very good programming languange for anything requiring a high degree of timing precision, like psychology experiments. OpenFrameworks and CX are both free and open source, distributed under the MIT license.

You can always get the most recent version of CX from its GitHub repository here: https://github.com/hardmanko/ofxCX.

The best place to start with CX is the \ref gettingStarted_page page, which includes installation information. After that, there are a variety of topics to read about.

+ Video
   * To learn about presenting visual stimuli, first read the \ref visualStimuli tutorial. 
   * For a variety of examples of drawing visual stimuli, see the `renderingTest` or `animation` examples or the `nBack` or `changeDetection` example experiments. 
   * See the \ref video page for reference on visual stimulus presentation.
+ Audio
   * To learn about playing or recording sounds, read the \ref audioIO tutorial. See also the \ref sound page and the `soundBuffer` example.
   * For an example of synthesizing sounds, see the `modularSynth` example.
+ To learn about collecting responses, read the \ref responseInput tutorial.
+ To learn how to store and output experiment data, read the \ref dataFrameTutorial tutorial. See also the \ref dataManagement page or see the `dataFrame` example.
+ To learn about random number generation, see the \ref randomNumberGeneration page or the `changeDetection` or `nBack` examples.
+ To learn about how CX logs errors and other runtime information, see the \ref errorLogging page or the `logging` example.
+ To learn about input and output timing, read the \ref ioTiming page.
+ General information about the structure of CX, including informaton about some of the software used by CX internally, can be found on the \ref programModel page.
+ Once you have completed developing an experiment, read the \ref experimentDeployment page to learn how to deploy the experiment to the computers that will actually run the experiment.
