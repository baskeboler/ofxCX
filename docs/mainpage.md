=========

ofxCX (aka the C++ Experiment System; hereafter referred to as CX) is a "total conversion mod" for openFrameworks (often abbreviated oF) that 
is designed to be used used for creating psychology experiments. OpenFrameworks and CX are based on C++, which
is a very good programming languange for anything requiring a high degree of timing precision. OpenFrameworks 
and CX are both free and open source, distributed under the MIT license.

One of the features that CX has is the ability to run without a substantial installation process.
When a CX program is compiled and linked, the resulting artifact is an executable binary that can be run directly with needing another program to be installed.
The collection of files needed to run a CX program starts at about 5 MB (zipped) for Windows, smaller on Linux. Installing the program just requires unzipping a file.


Topics
===========

The best way to get an overview of how CX works is to look at the \ref examplesAndTutorials.

+ To learn about presenting visual stimuli, go to the \ref video page or see the renderingTest or animation examples or the nBack or changeDetection example experiments.
+ To learn about playing, recording, and generating sounds, go to the \ref sound page or see the soundObject or modularSynth examples.
+ To learn how to store and output experiment data, see the \ref dataManagement page or see the dataFrame example.
+ To learn about random number generation, see the \ref randomNumberGeneration page.
+ To learn about how CX logs errors and other runtime information, see the \ref errorLogging page.

You can look at the \ref modulesPage page to see the other modules that CX has.
