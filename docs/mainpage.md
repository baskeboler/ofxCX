ofxCX (aka the C++ Experiment System; hereafter referred to as CX) is a "total conversion mod" for openFrameworks (often abbreviated oF) that 
is designed to be used used for creating psychology experiments. OpenFrameworks and CX are based on C++, which
is a very good programming languange for anything requiring a high degree of timing precision. OpenFrameworks 
and CX are both free and open source, distributed under the MIT license.

The best place to start with CX is the \ref gettingStarted_page page, which includes installation information. After that, there are a variety of topics to read about.

+ To learn about presenting visual stimuli, go to the \ref video page or see the `renderingTest` or `animation` examples or the `nBack` or `changeDetection` example experiments.
+ To learn about playing, recording, and synthesizing sounds, go to the \ref audioIO page. See also the \ref sound page, or see the `soundObject` or `modularSynth` examples.
+ To learn how to store and output experiment data, see the \ref dataManagement page or see the `dataFrame` example.
+ To learn about random number generation, see the \ref randomNumberGeneration page or the `changeDetection` or `nBack` examples.
+ To learn about how CX logs errors and other runtime information, see the \ref errorLogging page or the `logging` example.

You can look at the \ref modulesPage page to see the other modules that CX has.
